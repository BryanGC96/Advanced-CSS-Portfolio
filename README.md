# Advanced-CSS-Portfolio
Bootcamp Portfolio for Student

This Week Project Objective was to build a portfolio page for the bootcamp student "Bryan Gomez", this application is to be mostly used as a site were anyone can access to diferent projects done by the student, and in the future provide a place were I can update the page by adding new sections, the CV or any other necesary thing.

This was required to use only HTML and CSS.

To make the images in the "aside" section, I desided to use background images on CSS; but after discovering that i cannot use "alt=" attributes in CSS, one of the changes i will make in the future is to change it and take it out of the CSS and fix it in HTML.

Another problem was the positioning of the "section" in relation to the "aside" section, so another change to fix the visualization of itself, would be to take the "aside" section and remove it from "Main" so i can arrange the positioning in a easier way using percentages. (this will be fixed)
